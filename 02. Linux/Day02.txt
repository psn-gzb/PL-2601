Module 2: Linux Fundamentals | Day 02 | 31-12-2025
============================================================================================================
What is an OS?
OS is a software which is used to interact with the machines (Physical machines or Virtual machines)
It acts as a mediator between the user and the machine
OS is mandatory, because it provides an environment to run applications

Types of OS?
Windows, iOS, Andriod, Linux....

Linux OS is commonly in real-time

Windows Vs Linux
Windows is a single user based OS
Linux is multi-user based OS

Windows is premium
Linux is Free and Open Source
Netflix	-----> Java Code	----> If code is available for public use, then it is called as Open Source

Windows OS doesn't have better security features
Linux OS is fully secure

Windows OS is recommended for personal use
Linux OS is preferred for professional use

Windows OS is developed and owned by Microsoft organization
Linux OS is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows OS is GUI based
Linux OS is CLI based

All the commands in Linux OS are case sensitive 
mkdir	----> MKDIR

Linux Distributions/Flavours?
A Linux distribution is an OS that is built on top of Linux kernel
Different distributions are tailored for various use cases

Chicken Biryani	------> Hyderabad Biryani (Authentic)
Bangalore -----> Hyderabad Biryani
Chennai -----> Hyderabad Biryani

in AWS cloud, most of these distributions are available as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
	1. RPM based - RedHat Package Manager
		- RedHat
		- CentOS
		- Amazon Linux 2023

	2. Debian based
		- Suse
		- Ubuntu

Linux Architecture?
Linux follows a layered architecture.
3 main layers;
	shell
	kernel
	hardware components

To work with Linux OS, we will use Virtual Machines
AWS	------> EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Service	------> Launch Virtual Machines	------> MobaXTerm*/PuTTY -----> IP Address (Public IP & Private IP)

Launch Virtual Machines;
	Name: Linux Server (Optional)
	AMI: Select the OS - Amazon Linux
	Instance Type: t2.micro, t2.medium, t2.large.... Each instance type will charge accordingly (t2.micro)
	Key pair: Create a key-pair (Formats: .pem (MobaXTerm), .ppk (Putty)
	Networking: Default Network
	Storage: Default storage (8GB) - Extend upto 30 GB (Free)
	Number of instances: 1


100 Dollars	+ 100 Dollars	= 200 Dollars

Amazon Linux	-----> Username: ec2-user
Ubuntu			-----> Username: ubuntu

All servers in the cloud will follow UTC timezone

User types in servers;
	ec2-user (Amazon Linux) / ubuntu (Ubuntu)	- who will have least prevelages 
	root											- who will have all kinds of prevelages

ec2-user	($)---> /home/ec2-user path
sudo su	(#)---> root	----> /home/ec2-user path
sudo su - (#)---> root	----> /root ----> Default directory structure of linux
sudo -i (#)---> root	----> /root 
sudo su 

Default directory structure;
cd / ---> ls ----> Default directories
