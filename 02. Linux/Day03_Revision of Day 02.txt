Module 2: Linux Fundamentals | Day 03 | 05-01-2025 (Revision of Day 02)
============================================================================================================
Linux is one type of OS

What is an OS?
OS is a software which is used to communicate with the device (laptop/desktop/mobile/physical server/virtual server)

Types of OS?
Windows, Linux, Mac

A Linux OS is preferred in the real-time scenarios as a software engineer

Windows Vs Linux
Windows OS is single user based OS
Linux OS is multi user based OS

Windows OS is a premium (not free)
Linux OS is free and open source

Hotstar ----> Writing the code (5 months) ----> Code will not be kept in the public domain
Linux ----> Written the code (5 months) ----> Code kept in the public domain ----> Open Source

Windows is developed and owned by Microsoft
Linux is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows doesn't have better security features
Linux is fully secure

Windows is recommended for personal use
Linux is preferred for professional purposes

Windows is GUI based
Linux is CLI based

All the commands in Linux are case sensitive

Linux Distributions;
Any OS which is developed on top of original Linux code is known as Linux Distribution/Flavour
In AWS cloud, we call the distributions as AMIs (Amazon Machine Image)

1. RPM based (RedHat Package Manager)
	RedHat
	Cent OS
	Amazon Linux 2023

2. Debian based
	Suse
	Ubuntu

OS Type				Default user-name
Amazon Linux			ec2-user
Ubuntu					ubuntu
RedHat					ec2-user

Linux Architecture
Linux follows a layered architecture
It has 3 main layers
	Shell						- mediator between users and kernel
	Kernel						- it will receive the instructions from shell (heart of Linux OS)
	Hardware Components		- CPU, RAM, ....

AWS Cloud		------> EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)	-----> Launch an Instance (Virtual Server/Machine)		-----> Connect with VM	----> Execute the commands

Configurations to launch an instance;
Name the instance (optional)
Selection of AMI (OS) (Amazon Linux/Ubuntu/RedHat)
Selection of instance type (t2.micro, t2.nano, t2.medium, t2.large.....)
Network (default network - VPC)
Keypair (which is used to connect with the server)
Storage (EBS - default 8GB)
Number of instances (1)

==================================================
AWS Account
	Valid Email ID
	Valid PAN Card
	Valid Credit or Debit Card

Start with USD $100 in AWS credits, plus earn up to USD $100 by completing various activities.

10. Capstone Projects						- 1 day

AWS Cloud ----> EC2 Service
======================================================
Region ----> EC2 Service is a region specific service

For every instance that is launched, we will have a Public IP and Private IP
By using the Public IP we can connect with the server, especially by using 3rd party tools
By using the Private IP we can connect one server with another server internally

Public IP is dynamic - it changes whenever we stop and restart the same instance
Private IP is static

If you delete the instance, both the public IP and private IP will be deleted. And also, the entire data along with the instance will be deleted permanently. There is no way of getting back the server which is deleted/terminated.

All the servers in the AWS Cloud will follow UTC time zone
Universal Coordinated Timezone

In Linux we have users. By default we will get 2 types of users;
1. ec2-user (Amazon Linux), ubuntu (Ubuntu)	- which has least privileges 
2. root										- which has all kinds of privileges


ec2-user				/home/ec2-user			$ 
root					/home/ec2-user			# (sudo su)
root					/home/ec2-user			# (sudo -s)
root					/root					# (sudo su -)
root					/root					# (sudo -i)
