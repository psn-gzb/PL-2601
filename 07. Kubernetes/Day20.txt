K8s
Open-source container orchestration platform that automates;
	deployments
	scaling
	load balancing
	management of different applications
Originally developed by Google 2014
In 2015 CNCF has acquired K8s and made it open-source and free

What is a Cluster? Cluster Components?
A cluster means a group of servers (Physical Servers /Virtual Machines) that works together to run the containerized applications.
Control Plane / Master Node
	Manages scheduling, scaling, monitoring
Data Plane / Worker Nodes
	Each task coming from the control plane will get executed on the worker nodes

Types of Clusters;
Self Managed Clusters
	minikube	- single node cluster - for beginners
	kubeadm	- multi node cluster - manual maintenance 
	kops		- multi node cluster - manual maintenance 
	kind
	kubespray
	rancher

Cloud Managed Clusters
	AWS - EKS (Elastic K8s Service)**
	GCP - GKE (Google K8s Engine)
	Azure - AKS (Azure K8s Service)
	IBM - IKE (IBM K8s Engine)

Methods of Cluster Setup
	AWS Console
	CLI
	YAML
	Terraform

Creation of K8s Resources
Imperative		- commands will be execute	- create a pod	- kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx
Declarative		- YAML (manifest files)		- create a pod	- write the pod manifest					- execute the yml	- kubectl apply -f <FileName>.yml

Automation
Clarity
Reusability 

Any k8s manifest file will have an extension as .yml or .yaml

Structure of a Manifest File;
4 core sections of a manifest file
apiVersion	- defines the k8s workload / resource API Version
kind		- what type of k8s resource/workload you want to create
metadata	- here we will write information about the resource
spec		- here we will write the containers and image specifications
