DevOps Overview

Project - Netflix
Teams: 
1) Development Team (Developers) - Develop the application
2) Testing Team (Testers) - Test the code
3) Operations Team (Operations/DevOps Engineers) - Deploy the application into the servers - Manual, Automated
4) DB Team (DB Engineers) - Collect/Retrieve the data

Cloud Architects			- 8+ years	- design architecture 

Cloud Engineer			- Architectures - Infrastructure Setup
DevOps Engineer		- Infrastructure Setup + Automate the application deployment + Monitoring +Debugging
SRE					- Monitoring + Automate the application deployment
Platform Engineer		- Debugging + Monitoring + Automate the application deployment

Activities of Development Team
	Understand the client requirements
	Developing the code
	Store the code in the code repo (GitHub)
	Testing team tests the code

Activities of Operations Team
	Setup the infrastructure
	Build & Package of code - Artifacts
	Store the artifacts - Nexus/JFrog
	Code Quality Analysis - SonarQube 
	Application deployment
	Monitoring
	Debugging
	
SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
It is the process of developing and deploying the app into the servers

Phases of SDLC;
Requirements of client
Requirements gathering phase
Development team
Testing team
Operations team
Monitoring team
Deliver the app to the client
Monitoring team

SDLC Methodologies
Waterfall model
Spiral model
V model
....
Agile model


Waterfall model;
The entire process of developing an application will flow from top to bottom - linear methodology
Whenever client comes up with a new requirement, the process of developing an app will be starting from the beginning
The time to complete the project will be extended
The requirements of the client are fixed
The app cannot sustain in the market
Client can see the output of the app only after the deployment
There is a high chance for project failure
Client cannot give feedback

Agile model;
In this, the entire project will be divided into multiple parts (sprints)
PhonePe ----> Recharge, Insurance, Investment, Pay the bills, Money transactions....
Recharge feature --- developer - code, testing, deploying the code - call the client - feedback - enhance the app design - call the client - feedback --- deploy the feature
Insurance feature --- developer - code, testing, deploying the code - call the client - feedback - enhance the app design - call the client - feedback --- deploy the feature

Client involvement is very high
Continuous feedback
Continuous development
There is a high chance for success of the project
2001 - John Kern and Martin Fowler


Who is a DevOps engineer?
DevOps engineer is someone who is going to establish a communication between the different teams working for the project
